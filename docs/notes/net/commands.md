# Commands

- Dedicated server with operators:
  `<godot> --headless --path . -- --server --admin-password <pw>`; type commands straight into
  its stdin (`/admin add <name>`, `/say ...`, `/tpall <town>`). Client: add `--name <n>`.
- Server binds the IPv6 wildcard (`::`, dual-stack) so it answers on every interface including
  Tailscale; `--bind <ip>` restricts it to one. **ENet is UDP** — a forwarded port must be a
  UDP rule and TCP-only tunnels (ngrok free, Cloudflare Tunnel) cannot carry it.
  `--stream-bandwidth <MB/s>` caps terrain streaming per client; the 3 MB/s default is
  24 Mbit/s each and is a LAN figure.
- Deploying the server to a Linux host (tmux console, cron, firewall, mDNS): `general/linux-deploy`.
