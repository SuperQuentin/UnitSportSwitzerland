# To be tested by a human

What the headless checks could not verify: hands-on clicks, a real pad, a headset, a real-size region, a look or feel to judge.
Each PR that leaves something here adds it in the same change (`docs/notes/general/human-test-list.md`).
Once tested, delete the line, or note what was found (an issue link) and delete it once fixed.
Something to retest over and over belongs in the playtest suite instead (`tools/playtest.sh`, `general/playtest`).

Format: `- [ ] what to do → what should happen` under the feature's heading, with its PR.

## /locate and chat coordinates ([#1278](https://github.com/SuperQuentin/UnitSportSwitzerland/pull/1278))

Offline is enough for most: `--chunks D:/UnitSportSwitzerland/terrain_chunks --at 2538000,1152500` (Lausanne), then `/locate castle`.

- [ ] Click a pin or coordinates in an answer → the choices list opens beside it. Esc closes the list, and the chat stays open.
- [ ] Choices › **Teleport** → you land at the point. Online, on a server run with `--no-teleport` and not as an admin, it is refused with a reason, and Teleport is not in the list at all.
- [ ] Choices › **Track** → navigation's marker, compass and guiding wind point there. Pick Track on the same point again → tracking stops.
- [ ] Choices › **Show on map** → the adventure map opens centred on a red pin with the place's name.
- [ ] Choices › **Copy**, then paste into the chat and send → the sent line shows the coordinates with a pin, and its own choices work.
- [ ] Pad: hold Back › **Chat** → the chat opens on the "/" picker. Build `/locate church + spire` with the D-pad and A only, then Send. Move up to an answer line, press A → its choices open. B closes the choices, then the chat.
- [ ] VR: Menu hold › Chat → the picker and a point's choices can be pressed with the ray.
- [ ] Judge the size: the picker and choices buttons are 30 px tall (the usual `UiKit.Button` is 38 px). Comfortable on a pad and a 4K screen?
- [ ] Dev region (6,699 tiles), first server boot with `user://cache/locate/` deleted → the `[locate] building index: … in N ms` line. Estimated ~50 s: note the real time here. During the build, `/locate apartment building` from a player should answer at once round them, with the "isn't finished" note only when something unread is nearer.
- [ ] A region with `pois.bin` → `/locate a lake`, `/locate station`, `/locate church` (named after the survey's church) answer with names.

## Geneva lag, doors, sound occlusion setting ([#1282](https://github.com/SuperQuentin/UnitSportSwitzerland/pull/1282))

`--chunks D:/UnitSportSwitzerland/terrain_chunks --at 2500300,1118450` (Geneva).

- [ ] Spawn in Geneva, F4 or the perf overlay → steady frames near the GPU's time (measured 20 ms median, was 52 ms).
- [ ] Walk (no slide) into a house's open door, with the Adventure layer on → you go through, no climb up the facade. Push into a plain wall for a second → the climb still grabs it.
- [ ] Walk past a café or bar, then into one → its music fades in as you near it (it wakes within ~15 m of its reach) and plays inside.
- [ ] Settings › Audio › **Sound occlusion** off, stand behind a building from a playing car radio → heard as in the open; on → muffled again. Same row on a pad and in the VR panel.

## Interiors follow the building's outline ([#1294](https://github.com/SuperQuentin/UnitSportSwitzerland/pull/1294))

Generated world (the spawn's villages have an L, a U, a courtyard, a trapezoid and a bent block each within a few km: `--shapedcheck` prints where), or a real old town (Geneva above, Sion `--at 2594000,1120000`).

- [ ] Walk into a building with an angled facade → the rooms along it have one straight angled wall with windows, not a staircase, and nothing pokes through it. Walk along it: no snag, no gap to fall through at the corners.
- [ ] Walk into an L-shaped house → rooms in both arms (a hall down the far arm with rooms off it), none out in the yard.
- [ ] Look out of a window on an angled wall → the day's light comes in through it like any other.
- [ ] VR: walk into an angled room → the walls hold you (teleport into the corner too).
- [ ] A house drawn on the web with an angled wall (`--house-layouts`, see `net/house-layouts`) → that wall is one straight wall in the game, its door in it.
